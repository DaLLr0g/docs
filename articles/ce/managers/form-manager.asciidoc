<1> Creating a [classname]`FormManager` takes:
* a component to bind the manager connection context to the UI,
* an instance of [classname]`UserInfo` that represents the current local user, and
* the ID of the topic to connect to.

<2> The [methodname]`highlight()` method is used to mark the local user as editing a property.

<3> The [methodname]`setHighlightHandler()` method sets a callback to handle a user editing a property.
The property name and the `UserInfo` of the user are provided by the context passed as the argument to the callback.

<4> The callback returns another callback, a registration, that is called when the same user stops editing a property.

<5> The [methodname]`setValue()` method is used to set the value of a property.

<6> The [methodname]`setPropertyChangeHandler()` method sets a callback to handle a property value changing.
The property name and the new value are provided by the event passed as the argument to the callback.

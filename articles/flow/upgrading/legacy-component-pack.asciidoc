= Legacy Component Pack
:toclevels: 2

One of the biggest challenges in migrating from Vaadin 7 or 8 to the new web components based Vaadin Flow is the difference between the UI components in API and behavior.
The Legacy Component Pack is an add-on that provides a set of backwards compatible "legacy components" that ease migrating from Vaadin 7 or 8 to the latest Vaadin version.
The API, behavior and even DOM-structure of the componenets mimic, as closely as possible, to the existing components.

The first version of the pack will consist of the following components: `HorizontalLayout`, `VerticalLayot`, `Panel` and `Label`.
Each component either doesn't have a corresponding component available with Flow, or the behavior and API has changes so significantly, that it would require significant effort to modify the code to migrate it to Flow.
By using the legacy component pack, for the forementioned components, only the imports need to be changed to be able to use almost all of the same component features.

== License

The Legacy Component Pack is licensed under Commercial Vaadin Developer License 4.0 (CVDLv4) and part of the https://vaadin.com/pricing[Pro Subscription].
You will be asked to validate your license or start a trial period when you start to use it.

== Usage Instructions

The pack is aimed for to be used when migrating your project from Vaadin 7 or 8 to the latest Vaadin version.
The pack itself should work with any Vaadin version, but it is tested against the latest version.
For migrators, the recommendation is to migrate to the latest version.

To use the legacy components, you first need to add the dependency to your projects `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`:

. Add the pack dependency to [filename]#pom.xml#:

.`pom.xml`
[source,xml]

.Prerelease
[NOTE]
The pack is currently in prerelease state which means that you need to include the Vaadin prereleases Maven repository to your `<repositories>` listing.

After the dependency has been downloaded, you can start using the components by updating the component imports. For the components that are included in the pack, change the import statements to the corresponding legacy packages: from `com.vaadin.ui` to `com.vaadin.legacy.ui`.
